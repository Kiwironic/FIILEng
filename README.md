**What is this?**

FIIL audio devices are amazing value for money, and has an app to control everything for the ultimate user experience.
The problem is, the application is in Chinese, and the English app they have doesn't support most devices!!

This is where I come, the Chinese app is not fully translated and supporting all devices.

Enjoy.
